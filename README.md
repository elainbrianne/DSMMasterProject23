## Abstract 

This project introduces a novel technique called "differential machine learning" to estimate option prices and their deltas under the Heston model. Although option pricing under the Heston model has been done in the past, predicting sensitivities like deltas is not as straightforward, as it involves computing the derivatives of an estimated price function, which are historically not good approximates. Differential machine learning aims to remedy this issue with the aim of approximating the shape of the underlying function, by training on differentials of the target variable with respect to the input variables. Using a twin network architecture, we find that training on pathwise differentials and option price labels yields significantly  better results compared to training on price labels alone. Moreover, the performance of the differential twin network surpasses standard training whether we use a train-test split on a dataset generated by Monte Carlo simulations, or a noisier training set generated via the least squares Monte Carlo method. Notably, our network is capable of computing both prices and deltas much faster in a single pass.
